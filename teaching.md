## Teaching philosophy and experience

As an educator, I look to innovate in ways to engage students in the process of doing science. To this end, my teaching employs problem-based learning techniques; integrates research and teaching and student peer review; and utilizes real world examples to engage students across disciplines.

I have instructed and developed curriculum for a flagship course on research methods in paleobiology at UT Austin that teaches students of all levels how to do science through primary literature review, in-class peer review of scientific writing, and data analysis and visualization using R. I have also been involved in teaching statistics and programming in R to my colleagues (Programming and Applied Statistics using R workshop, various lab meeting workshops), and I have experience teaching diverse lab courses in Comparative Vertebrate Morphology, Microbiology, Ornithology, Principle of Biology, and Genetics.

## Research Mentorship

I have been mentoring diverse students at The University of Texas at Austin (8 undergraduates, 1 McNair Scholar) on research involving the evolution of melanin-based color in birds, color reconstruction in extinct dinosaurs, and integument evolution. In the past, I have co-mentored undergraduate biology students at the University of Akron (Jean-Pierre Iskandar, Chance Mitan) that have developed independent research projects, conducted the work, and won various awards for their presentations. One student, Jean-Pierre Iskandar (pictured below) is first author on a recent publication in the _Biological Journal of the Linnean Society_. These close interactions have helped shape my own thinking about how people learn and ways to more effectively communicate aspects of my own research.
