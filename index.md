<!-- i need to rethink this, spend more time on it -->

I am an evolutionary morphologist who uses a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental work to study the evolution of complex morphological traits in birds.

A key focus of my research <!-- question I am working on  -->is identifying the mechanistic underpinnings for why some groups of organisms are more phenotypically diverse than others. I focus on color traits in birds because of the unique diversifying role of sexual selection and because iridescent feather colors can be modeled with computer software (based on morphology). In addition to this color work, I am also investigating biomechanical diversity in bird skulls and developing computational approaches for dealing with large phenotypic datasets.
 
<!-- I am broadly interested in understanding why some groups of organisms are more phenotypically diverse than others, a longstanding challenge in evolutionary biology. My approach to science involves: i) searching for novel phenotypes and non-model functional systems that may be common in nature but have eluded attention, ii) leveraging computational approaches to understand form-function relationships and evolutionary diversification of these complex functional systems, and iii) integrating my research and teaching through problem-based learning activities and undergraduate research mentorship. -->

<!-- Although I have primarily focused on birds, I have also worked with non-avian taxa (butterfly fish, tarantulas, and orb-weaving spiders–see my publication in Biol. Letters). In addition, I have experience with diverse microscopy techniques (TEM, SEM, AFM), phylogenetic/comparative methods (BEAST, MrBayes, diversitree, OUwie), and coding languages (Scheme, R–see my recent publication in Methods Ecol. Evol.), and I have spent considerable time sampling from museum collections. -->
