<!-- i need to rethink this, spend more time on it -->

I am an evolutionary biologist who uses a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental work, primarily in birds, to study how complex traits evolve.

A key question I am working on is why some groups of birds are more phenotypically diverse than others. I use bird feathers as a model system for studying complex trait evolution because feathers are _morphologically diverse_ and they serve _multiple functions_ in the lives of birds (thermoregulation, color signaling, water repellency), many of which can be explored theoretically using mathematical models. In addition to my work on feather coloration, I am also investigating biomechanical and cranial diversity in birds and developing computational approaches for dealing with large phenotypic datasets.

<!-- more powerful word than investigating? -->



<!-- I am broadly interested in understanding why some groups of organisms are more phenotypically diverse than others, a longstanding challenge in evolutionary biology. My approach to science involves: i) searching for novel phenotypes and non-model functional systems that may be common in nature but have eluded attention, ii) leveraging computational approaches to understand form-function relationships and evolutionary diversification of these complex functional systems, and iii) integrating my research and teaching through problem-based learning activities and undergraduate research mentorship. -->

<!-- Although I have primarily focused on birds, I have also worked with non-avian taxa (butterfly fish, tarantulas, and orb-weaving spiders–see my publication in Biol. Letters). In addition, I have experience with diverse microscopy techniques (TEM, SEM, AFM), phylogenetic/comparative methods (BEAST, MrBayes, diversitree, OUwie), and coding languages (Scheme, R–see my recent publication in Methods Ecol. Evol.), and I have spent considerable time sampling from museum collections. -->
