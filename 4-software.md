### phenotools

phenotools provides functionality for inputting phenomic datasets; merging datasets into a single phenomic dataset based on a common set of taxa; annotating characters based on fuzzy text searching/trait ontologies; filtering overlapping phenomic characters and taxa (e.g. merging taxa into supraspecific terminals); visualizing similarities in character description; and outputting phenomic datasets to common phylogenetic data formats for downstream analysis (Figure 1).
