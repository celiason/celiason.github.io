## phenotools

phenotools provides functionality for inputting phenomic data sets; merging data sets into a single phenomic data set based on a common set of taxa; annotating characters based on fuzzy text searching/trait ontologies (see image below); filtering overlapping phenomic characters and taxa (e.g. merging taxa into supraspecific terminals); visualizing similarities in character description; and outputting phenomic data sets to common phylogenetic data formats for downstream analysis.
