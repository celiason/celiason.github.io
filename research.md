## Evolutionary biophotonics

I use optical models to link form and function. I then use these models to calculate how many colors birds can theoretically produce with a given color-producing mechanism. Comparing this "theoretical colorspace" to the observed values in nature sheds light on potential developmental constraints and tradeoffs limiting color diversity.

## Signal evolution in birds

I am interested in exploring proximate mechanisms for color traits in dabbling ducks (Anatidae) using multivariate comparative methods to estimate divergence rates for morphological and optical variables.

Bird feathers are made up of keratin. Keratin is a protein that is "sticky" when around water. I studied these non-ornamental properties of plumages and found that these properties trade off with ornamental color properties in ducks. (add self-cleaning picture) - In future work, I would like to incorporate climatic data to test global patterns of brightness variation... (can I get at this with the duck spectral data i have? what is the prediction?)

## Computational approaches for manipulating and visualizing large phenotypic datasets

I am currently working on an NSF-funded grant exploring morphological and molecular evolution in "primitive" birds, palaeognaths. Recent molecular evidence (cite) shows that the tinamous, a group of ~50 flying birds, are actually nested within the non-flying ratites. This implies that - add pic of ostrich, moa?

## Other projects:

I worked on various field projects in the "Big Woods" of Arkansas. The goal was to understand the habitat preferences and breeding behaviors of large woodpeckers, like the pileated woodpeckers shown below.
