I am broadly interested in understanding why some groups of organisms are more phenotypically diverse than others, a longstanding challenge in evolutionary biology. My approach to science involves: 1) leveraging computational approaches to model form-function relationships in complex functional systems in nature (e.g., layered nanostructures in bird feathers), 2) searching for novel phenotypes and non-model functional systems that may be common in nature but have escaped our attention, and 3) integrating my research and teaching (through problem-based learning activities and undergraduate research mentorship).

Most of my research focuses on three main areas:

<!-- I've looked at several different functional systems (iridescence, sound production mechanisms). ___Why are iridescent colors a good system to understand how evolution works?___

- colors change with angle

- colors can be modeled with computational approaches
- colors, structures evolve really fast

## Proximate mechanisms and innovations in signal production in birds

<!-- ## Evolutionary biophotonics -->

I use optical models to link form and function. I then use these models to calculate how many colors birds can theoretically produce with a given color-producing mechanism. Comparing this theoretical colorspace to empirical values in extant species sheds light on potential developmental constraints and tradeoffs limiting color diversity.

## Macroevolutionary trends in signal diversity

(among-species variation in feather hue within a single clade of dabbling ducks)

Animals communicate in diverse ways (using chemicals, sounds, colors, and touch). I am interested in understanding how the properties of these different kinds of signaling systems (call frequency, color) diversify through sexual selection. I use comparative methods to test hypotheses originating from my work on proximate mechanisms of how signals are produced (see above). Previous work shows how a "malleable" and highly conserved array of pigment granules within bird feathers explains the fast rates and independent evolution of brightness evolution compared to hue.

## Materials science and tradeoffs/costs of sexually selected signals

<!-- ## Integrating materials science and sexual selection -->

The external surface (integument, eggshell) is the primary interface between an organism and its environment. Water is ubiquitous in nature, and can be a selective agent for material properties of these surfaces. For example, bird feathers are made up of keratin, a protein that "sticks" to water. Because of this, variation in the brightness of color signals in ducks is closely related to how water repellent the feathers are. This means that non-ornamental properties of bird feathers can tradeoff with ornamental color properties. In future work, I would like to incorporate climatic data to test global patterns of signal variation in relation to climatic factors (precipitation, humidity). <!-- .. (can I get at this with the duck spectral data i have? what is the prediction?) -->

## Computational approaches for manipulating and visualizing large phenotypic datasets

I am currently working on an NSF-funded grant exploring morphological and molecular evolution in palaeognaths (including the largest bird that ever lived, the elephant bird). Recent molecular evidence shows that tinamous, a group of ~50 flying birds, are actually nested within the flightless, large-bodied "ratites", suggesting several losses of flight that may be linked to variation in other life history, behavioral, or morphological traits. I am currently working ways to automate the process of assembling information on these traits from the literature and understanding _how convergent evolution works_ using flightless ratites as a model system.

## Field work and other projects

I worked on various field projects in the "Big Woods" of Arkansas. The goal was to understand the habitat preferences and breeding behaviors of large woodpeckers, like the pileated woodpeckers shown below.
