I am broadly interested in understanding why some groups of organisms are more phenotypically diverse than others, a longstanding challenge in evolutionary biology. <!-- My approach to science involves: 1) leveraging computational approaches to model form-function relationships in complex functional systems in nature (e.g., layered nanostructures in bird feathers), 2) searching for novel phenotypes and non-model functional systems that may be common in nature but have escaped our attention, and 3) integrating my research and teaching (through problem-based learning activities and undergraduate research mentorship). --> Most of my research focuses on four main areas:

<!-- I've looked at several different functional systems (iridescence, sound production mechanisms). ___Why are iridescent colors a good system to understand how evolution works?___

- colors change with angle

- colors can be modeled with computational approaches
- colors, structures evolve really fast

## Proximate mechanisms and innovations in signal production

I use optical models to link form and function. I then use these models to calculate how many colors birds can theoretically produce with a given color-producing mechanism. Comparing this theoretical colorspace to empirical values in extant species sheds light on potential developmental constraints and tradeoffs limiting color diversity.

## Macroevolutionary trends in signal diversity

<!-- (among-species variation in feather hue within a single clade of dabbling ducks) -->

Animals communicate in diverse ways (using chemicals, sounds, colors, and touch). I am interested in understanding how the properties (call frequency, color) of these different kinds of signaling systems diversify through sexual selection. To tackle this question, I use multivariate comparative methods to test hypotheses about how proximate mechanisms of how signals are produced (see above) can explain signal evolution. As an example of this approach, previous work on color evolution in dablling ducks shows how a "malleable", highly conserved array of pigment granules in wing feathers explains fast rates and independent evolution of brightness compared to hue.

## Materials science and tradeoffs/costs of signals <!-- surfaces? -->

<!-- ## Integrating materials science and sexual selection -->

The external surface of animals (integument, eggshell) is the primary interface between an organism and its environment. Water is ubiquitous in nature, and can be a selective agent for material properties of these surfaces. For example, bird feathers are made up of keratin, a protein that "sticks" to water. Because of this, water in the environment can cause feathers to swell and change color when humidity is high (Eliason and Shawkey 2010). In addition, the way keratin is structured at the surface of feathers can influence both color and water repellency of feathers. This means that non-ornamental properties of feathers tradeoff with ornamental color properties (Eliason and Shawkey 2011). In future work, I will be testing trends in how colors spread out (both across a bird's body and geographically in relation to variation in climatic factors

## Computational approaches for manipulating and visualizing large phenotypic datasets

<!-- <img src="/img/character_accumulation.png"> -->

Most of my research involves working with and manipulating large phenotypic datasets. I am therefore interested in finding ways to use computational approaches to make this process simpler and faster. I am currently working on an NSF-funded grant exploring morphological and molecular evolution in palaeognaths (including the largest bird that ever lived, the elephant bird). Recent molecular evidence shows that tinamous, a group of ~50 flying birds, are actually nested within the flightless, large-bodied "ratites", suggesting several losses of flight that may be linked to variation in other life history, behavioral, or morphological traits. I am currently working on automating the process of assembling data on these traits from the literature, as well as understanding _how convergent evolution works_ using flightless ratites as a model system.

<!-- ## Field work and other projects

I worked on various field projects in the "Big Woods" of Arkansas. The goal was to understand the habitat preferences and breeding behaviors of large woodpeckers, like the pileated woodpeckers shown below.
