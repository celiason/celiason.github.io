I am broadly interested in understanding why some groups of organisms are more phenotypically diverse than others. <!-- My research spans the fields of evolutionary morphology, sexual selection, and functional morphology.  -->Specifically, my research focuses on four main areas about the evolution of complex traits:

<!-- Why color? -->

<!-- Why bird feathers? -->

<!-- Evolution of animal signal traits

Material science

Macroevolutionary modeling

Computational approaches for dataset assembly

Complex functional system evolution
 -->

<!-- I've looked at several different functional systems (iridescence, sound production mechanisms). ___Why are iridescent colors a good system to understand how evolution works?___

- colors change with angle

- colors can be modeled with computational approaches
- colors, structures evolve really fast

## Innovations in signal production

<!-- ## Evolutionary biophotonics -->

<img src="/img/nanostructures.png">

I use optical <!-- finite element? physical? mathematical? --> models to link form and function in complex traits (for example, the arrays of pigment granules in bird feathers, shown above). I then use these models to calculate the range of colors birds theoretically produce compared to observed values in nature. This approach has shed light on potential constraints and innovations in color production across Aves.

## Macroevolutionary trends in signal diversity

<!-- ## Signal evolution in birds -->

<img src="/img/duckbarbs2.jpg">

<!-- (among-species variation in feather hue within a single clade of dabbling ducks) -->

Animals communicate in diverse ways (using chemicals, sounds, colors, and touch). I am interested in understanding how the properties (call frequency, color) of these different kinds of signaling systems diversify<!--  through sexual selection -->. To tackle this question, I use multivariate comparative methods to test hypotheses about the interplay between how signals are produced and how they evolve. As an example of this approach, my colleagues and I studies color evolution in dabbling ducks. This work revealed how a morphological innovation (complex array of pigment granules) explains the rapid and independent evolution of different color traits in duck wing feathers (Eliason et al. 2015).

## Materials science and tradeoffs in nature

<!-- ## Integrating materials science and sexual selection -->

<img src="/img/water_on_feather.jpg">

<!-- <img src="/img/banner1.jpg"> -->

The external surface of animals (integument, eggshell) is the primary interface between an organism and its environment. Water is ubiquitous in nature, and can be important in the function and evolution of the material properties of these surfaces. For example, bird feathers are made up of keratin, a protein that "sticks" to water. Because of this, water in the environment can cause feathers to swell and change color when humidity is high (Eliason and Shawkey 2010). In addition, the way keratin is structured at the surface of feathers can influence both color and water repellency of feathers. This means that non-ornamental properties of feathers tradeoff with ornamental color properties (Eliason and Shawkey 2011). In future work, I will be looking at biogeographic trends in color patterns <!-- trends in how color "spreads out" (both across a bird's body and geographically) --> in relation to environmental factors.

## Computational approaches for phenome assembly

<img src="/img/character_accumulation.png">

<!-- <img src="/img/character_fate.jpg"> -->

Much of my research involves dealing with and manipulating large phenotypic datasets. I am therefore interested in finding ways to use computational approaches to make this process simpler and faster. I am currently working on an NSF-funded grant exploring morphological and molecular evolution in palaeognaths (including the largest bird that ever lived, the elephant bird). Recent molecular evidence shows that the flighted tinamous (a group of ~50 "chicken-like" birds) are phylogenetically nested within the large-bodied flightless "ratites", suggesting several losses of flight potentially linked to variation in other morphological, behavioral, or life history traits within the palaeognaths (ratites and tinamous). I am currently working on _automating the process of assembling phenotypic data_ on these traits from the literature (i.e. building the "phenome" for palaeognaths), as well as understanding _how convergent evolution works_ using flightless ratites as a model system.

<!-- ## Field work and other projects

I worked on various field projects in the "Big Woods" of Arkansas. The goal was to understand the habitat preferences and breeding behaviors of large woodpeckers, like the pileated woodpeckers shown below.
